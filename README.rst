Introduction
============
FPBlockAverager is a Python class and command-line tool used to estimate the
standard error of time-correlated data using the block-averaging method of
Flyvbjerg and Petersen, as described in `Flyvbjerg, H., and Petersen, H. G.
Error estimates on averages of correlated data. Journal of Chemical Physics.
1989. 91 (1). 461-466.
